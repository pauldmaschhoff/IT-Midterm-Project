## Family

### Mom
---
My mom works at _Lutheran High School South_, the high school that I attended in St. Louis. She works in admissions and works on many different things at the school. I absolutely love my mom's cooking and is one of the things I really miss about being away at school.

### Dad
---
My dad works as an attounrey at [SmithAmundsen](https://www.smithamundsen.com/), a law firm in St. Louis. I love watching different shows with my dad as we watched _The Walking Dead_ and _The Mandalorian_ together.
