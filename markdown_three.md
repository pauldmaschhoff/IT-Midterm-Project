### My Computer
---
I have had a love for technology my whole life and have always loved tinkering with all the technology I could get my hands on. My freshman year of high school I had saved enough money to buy computer parts at [Microcenter](https://www.microcenter.com/). I then reserached and built the computer and had lots of fun doing it. Since then I have continued to upgrade parts and tinker with my computer whenever I can.
