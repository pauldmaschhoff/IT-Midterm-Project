### My Computer
---
I have had a love for technology my whole life and have always loved tinkering with all the technology I could get my hands on. My freshman year of high school I had saved enough money to buy computer parts at [Microcenter](https://www.microcenter.com/). I then reserached and built the computer and had lots of fun doing it. Since then I have continued to upgrade parts and tinker with my computer whenever I can.

### Programming Experience
---
While atttending Mizzou I have been able to learning and practice programming. By completing CS 1050 and by currently taking CS 2050 and INFOTC 1000 I have developed skills in different programming languages including:

* **_C_**
* **_Python_**
* **_HTML_**
* **_Javascript_**

Here is an example of code showing some new skills that I learned in Python: 

```python
# Calculate Volume of a Cone Program
cone_radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the cone: "))
cone_height = float(input("Enter the height of the cone: "))
print("Radius:", cone_radius)
print("Height:", cone_height)
print()
pi = 3.142
cone_volume = pi * cone_radius * cone_radius * (cone_height/3)
print("The volume of the cone is:", cone_volume)
```
