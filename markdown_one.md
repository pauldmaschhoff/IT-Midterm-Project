## My Interests

### Sports
---
Coming from St. Louis I have always been following our   city's sports teams. I love following different teams and getting invested in the different ups and downs that come in a season. Some of my favorite teams are:

* St. Louis Cardinals (Baseball).
 * Kansas City Chiefs (Football).
 * St. Louis Blues (Hockey).

### Video Games

Ever since I was in elementary school playing Wii Sports on the Nintendo Wii I have had a love for video games. As   technology has evolved I can now play online with friends with games such as: _Destiny_, _Overwatch_, _Call of Duty_ and many more. [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/) has brought many good times to me and my friends and I look forward to the good time to come.
