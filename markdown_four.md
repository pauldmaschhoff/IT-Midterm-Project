## Entertainment

### Movies and TV Shows
---
I love to watch movies. Movies offer a type of entertainment that you cannot get anywhere else. All different types of genres of movies are all entertaining in their own right. The demand for movies and other forms of entertainment will always be there as people use movies as an escape from the troubles of life and just stop to have fun with a few friends and to watch a movie together. Some of my favorite movies are:

* _The Dark Knight_
* _Guardians of the Galaxy_
* _The Godfather Trilogy_
* _Star Wars Saga_

The silver screen also offers a lot of entertainment as well. I might actually like shows more than movies because there is more time for the story and characters to evolve and when the climax of the story hits it tends to have a bigger effect because of that reason. With streaming services TV shows are getting better than ever. Here are some of my favorites:

* _Breaking Bad_
* _Prison Break_
* _The Mandalorian_
* _Attack on Titan_
